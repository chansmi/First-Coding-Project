# Team-Roster
(2020) Frist coding project

## Overview

This project is from CS5004 - Object Oriented Design.The overall purpose of this project was to setup a relational database using a code structure that implements the core concepts of OOD. Throughout the code, you will see comments that explain what each method or piece of a method is doing. Additionally,  “//TEST:” indicates where I tested the application after each method implementation. As this was a new concept in many regards, I relied heavily on external learning materials. I have cited these sources in my code but the code and overall design are my own!

Due to the local database involved in this project, you will not be able to replicate it without setting up your own database. Please see the screenshots and video below for a view of the functionality.
